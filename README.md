# calculator-top
 The Ultimate project of the Foundations part of The Odin Project, a simple calculator done in the style of Windows 95.
 
For this project, I didn't focus as much on CSS as I did for example for my Etch-a-Sketch. My main focus here was the logic behind the calculator, and getting the javascript done and working properly.
 
Overall, this seemed challenging at first, because I was trying to do the algorithm in a weird way.
Then came the idea of using an object to keep track of my numbers and operators, after which it was basically a breeze to get it working properly.
